In today’s competitive job market, a resume isn’t just a document—it’s your first impression. The AI Resume Checker is designed to bridge the gap between human recruiters and applicants by giving personalized, actionable feedback on resumes.

The system uses Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze resumes in real-time. It can:

Identify missing keywords that match the job description.

Suggest improvements in formatting, readability, and clarity.

Highlight strengths and weak points in work experience, skills, and education.

Score resumes based on impact and relevance, helping candidates understand how their resume performs compared to industry standards.

What makes it human-like and interactive:

Users get detailed, easy-to-understand feedback, not just a score.

It can provide examples of better phrasing, helping the candidate learn while improving their resume.

The system can even adapt recommendations based on role or industry, so it feels personalized rather than generic.

This project demonstrates not only full-stack development skills (frontend + backend + AI integration) but also an understanding of how AI can improve real human experiences, like job hunting
